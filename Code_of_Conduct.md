# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers of the logisticsshippingrate project pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Showing empathy and respect toward other people
- Being open to constructive feedback and differing viewpoints
- Gracefully accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Violent, harassing, discriminatory, or hateful language or imagery
- Degrading comments, personal attacks, or publications of private information
- Sexual language and imagery or unwelcome sexual attention
- Sustained disruption of discussions or other deliberate interference with project activities
- Advocating for, encouraging, or enabling any of the above behavior

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, up to and including temporary or permanent bans from the project.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from project leadership.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Reporting

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it as soon as possible. You can report incidents by contacting the project maintainers at: CODE_OF_CONDUCT_CONTACT_EMAIL@example.com

All reports will be handled with discretion and with respect for the privacy of all parties involved. When possible, include:

- A description of the incident
- The names (or GitHub handles) of those involved
- Any relevant screenshots, links, or logs
- The date, time, and location (e.g., issue thread, PR, Discord/Slack channel)

Reports may be reviewed by a small group of maintainers or an appointed Code of Conduct committee.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Possible actions that maintainers may take in response to a reported violation include:

- A private, written warning to the offender
- Temporary restrictions on participation (e.g., limited commenting privileges)
- Temporary or permanent removal from project spaces or communication channels
- Public or private statements describing the resolution

The severity of the response will depend on the circumstances, including whether the behavior is a repeat offense and whether it is malicious or accidental.
